# git-gone

A Git plugin for cleaning up merged git branches interactively using fuzzy finder.
Works as a native Git extension: `git gone`

## Features

- üîÑ Updates all local references with origin
- üéØ Detects branches ready for deletion using multiple methods:
  - Branches merged into the default branch (traditional merge)
  - Branches with deleted remotes (squash/rebase merges)
  - Platform-independent operation (works regardless of system language)
- üîç Interactive multi-selection using go-fzf
- ‚úÖ Safe deletion with confirmation prompt
- üìä Clear status indicators throughout the process

## Installation

### Quick install (recommended)

```bash
# Download and run the installation script
# Will download pre-built binary if available, or build from source automatically
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theburrowhub/git-gone/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Note**: The installation script will automatically:
- Try to download pre-built releases if available
- Fall back to building from source if no releases exist (requires Git and Go 1.19+)
- Install the binary to `~/.local/bin` by default

### From source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/theburrowhub/git-gone.git
cd git-gone

# Use the installation script for local build
./install.sh

# Or build manually
go build -o git-gone
sudo mv git-gone /usr/local/bin/
```

### Download binary

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/theburrowhub/git-gone/releases) for your platform.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Navigate to any git repository and run:

```bash
git gone
# or
git-gone
# or explicitly
git-gone branches
```

### Available Commands

- **`git-gone` or `git-gone branches`**: Clean up merged branches (default)
- **`git-gone version`**: Show version information
- **`git-gone help`**: Show help information

### What the tool does:
1. Update all remote references (`git fetch --all --prune`)
2. Identify the default branch (main/master)
3. Find deletable branches using two methods:
   - Branches merged into the default branch (traditional merges)
   - Branches whose remote tracking branch is gone (squash/rebase merges)
4. Present an interactive list where you can:
   - Use arrow keys to navigate
   - Press `Tab` or `Space` to select/deselect branches
   - Press `Enter` to confirm selection
   - Press `Esc` to cancel
   - Type to filter branches by name
5. Ask for confirmation before deleting selected branches
6. Delete the selected branches safely

## Command Structure

git-gone uses a subcommand structure powered by Cobra:

```bash
# Show general help
git-gone --help
git-gone -h

# Show version
git-gone version

# Clean branches (default command)
git-gone
git-gone branches

# Get help for specific command
git-gone branches --help
```

**Note**: When using as a Git plugin (`git gone`), commands work the same way:
- `git gone` - runs branch cleanup
- `git gone version` - shows version
- `git gone -h` - shows help

## Interactive Controls

- **‚Üë/‚Üì**: Navigate through the list
- **Tab/Space**: Toggle selection of current branch
- **Enter**: Confirm selection and proceed
- **Esc**: Cancel operation
- **Type**: Filter branches by name

## Safety Features

- Never deletes the default branch (main/master)
- Never deletes the current branch
- Shows only branches that have been merged
- Requires explicit confirmation before deletion
- Attempts safe deletion first (`git branch -d`)
- Falls back to force deletion only if necessary

## Requirements

- Go 1.19 or higher
- Git installed and configured
- Terminal with UTF-8 support (for emoji indicators)

## Dependencies

- [github.com/koki-develop/go-fzf](https://github.com/koki-develop/go-fzf) - Fuzzy finder library

## How it Works as a Git Plugin

When you install `git-gone`, the binary is placed in your `$PATH`. Git automatically recognizes executables named `git-<command>` as git subcommands, allowing you to use it as `git gone`.

## Development

### Creating a new release

Releases are automatically created when you push a tag starting with `v`:

```bash
# Create a new tag
git tag v0.3.0 -m "Release version 0.3.0"

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v0.3.0
```

GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. Build binaries for all platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
2. Create a GitHub release with the binaries
3. Generate checksums for all files
